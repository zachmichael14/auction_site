# Auction style e-commerce site using Django

## Introduction
With this project, I wanted to create a more fully featured Django application that I could take through deployment. 

Don't mind the mess, it's a work in progress.

### User functionality to add:

* ~~Register for an account~~
* ~~Login/logout~~
* List an item for sale
* Bid on an item
* Add item to watchlist
* Update profile and profile picture
* Comment on an item
* Update item information and image
* Delete an item if bidding has not begun


### Goals for this project
* Make forms crispy
* Explore model managers
* Create separate apps
* Explore S3 buckets for storing profile and item images
* Use class-based views
* Explore deployment with Heroku
