# Auction style e-commerce site using Django

## Introduction
**Please excuse the mess - work in progress**

With this project, I wanted to create a more fully featured Django application that I could take through deployment. 

The website is set up as an Ebay-like auction website where users can create an account and bid on items.

The production database will be built with PostgreSQL, and I intend to deploy using Heroku and I'm exploring AWS's S3 buckets to provide image storage.
